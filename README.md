# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection Using CNN

## Objective
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin lesion images as benign or malignant (melanoma). By leveraging deep learning, it aims to aid dermatologists in early detection, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing mortality rates associated with melanoma.

## Technology Overview
- **Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras are used to design, train, and evaluate the CNN model.
- **Dataset**:
  - Images are structured in `train/` and `test/` directories, categorized into `benign/` and `malignant/` subfolders.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images are resized to a uniform shape (e.g., 224x224).
  - Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].
- **Training Configuration**:
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy
- **Evaluation Metric**:
  - Accuracy is the primary metric used for training and validation.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into the following structure:
- **train/**: Contains training images categorized into different skin lesion types.
- **test/**: Contains test images categorized into different skin lesion types.

Each folder represents a different type of lesion, with the images inside labeled according to their category.

## Commit History
Hereâ€™s a summary of the recent changes in the dataset:
- **Added test and train files** for the following categories:
  - Actinic keratosis
  - Basal cell carcinoma
  - Dermatofibroma
  - Melanoma
  - Nevus
  - Pigmented benign keratosis
  - Seborrheic keratosis
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Vascular lesion

## Design

### Process Flow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Images are loaded using TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory` utility.
   - The data is split into training and validation datasets, with a separate test dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resized images to the required input dimensions (224x224x3).
   - Pixel values normalized to a [0, 1] range for stability during training.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Extract meaningful features from images.
   - **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions to simplify learning.
   - **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting.
   - **Dense Layers**: Perform binary classification using the sigmoid activation function.

4. **Training**:
   - The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
   - The validation loss is monitored to determine when training stops.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy is calculated on the test dataset to measure the model's performance.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- TensorFlow and Keras installed.

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gauranga08/Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detection.git
cd Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detection

### Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Dataset Setup
Ensure your dataset follows the structure outlined in the Dataset Structure section. You should place the images in the appropriate train/ and test/ directories.

### Run the Notebook
You can now run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook melanoma_skin_detection.ipynb
This will open the notebook in your default web browser where you can interact with the code and see the results of training.

### Outputs
- Training Logs: Training and validation accuracy and loss per epoch.
- Final Test Accuracy: Evaluated on the test dataset.
- Saved Model: The trained model is saved locally for future predictions.
